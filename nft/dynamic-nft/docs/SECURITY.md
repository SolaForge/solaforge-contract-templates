# Security Considerations for dynamic-nft

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the dynamic-nft template.

## Key Security Considerations

### Authority Controls

- **Account Authority**: Only the designated authority can perform operations.
- **Signature Verification**: All instructions require proper signing.

### Data Validation

- **Input Validation**: All instruction parameters are validated before use.
- **Numerical Safety**: Math operations check for overflows/underflows.

## Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

1. **Unauthorized Access**: Ensure authority checks are in place for all operations.
2. **Numerical Errors**: Use checked math operations for all calculations.
3. **Incorrect Initialization**: Validate all accounts during initialization.

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure all instruction paths are covered by tests.
2. **Start Small**: Begin with limited functionality and expand as security is verified.
3. **Consider Auditing**: For production use, consider a professional audit.

## Known Limitations

- Basic implementation with limited features
- Not optimized for all use cases

## Security Testing

Before production deployment:

1. Test all instruction paths
2. Verify error conditions are properly handled
3. Test edge cases with maximum/minimum values

## Emergency Procedures

In case of identified vulnerabilities:

1. Assess the severity and potential impact
2. Develop a fix or mitigation strategy
3. Deploy updates through proper governance channels
