# Security Considerations for NFT Marketplace

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the NFT Marketplace template.

## Key Security Considerations

### Authority Controls

- **Marketplace Authority**: Only the designated authority can update marketplace parameters.
- **Seller Authority**: Only the NFT owner can list or cancel a listing.
- **Token Ownership**: Strict verification of NFT ownership before listing.

### Transaction Validation

- **Listing Status**: Prevent operations on inactive listings.
- **Price Validation**: Ensure prices are non-zero and reasonable.
- **Fee Validation**: Cap fee percentages to prevent excessive fees.

### Account Validation

- **Account Ownership**: Verify all accounts are owned by the expected programs.
- **NFT Verification**: Ensure token accounts hold exactly 1 token and match the specified mint.
- **Marketplace Validation**: Confirm marketplace and treasury accounts match.

## Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

1. **Double Selling**: Prevent the same NFT from being sold twice by properly updating listing status.
2. **Fee Manipulation**: Cap fees and validate fee calculations to prevent draining funds.
3. **Unauthorized Delistings**: Only allow the original seller to cancel a listing.
4. **Incorrect Fund Transfers**: Ensure funds are correctly distributed between seller and treasury.

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Start with Audited Code**: Always begin with security-audited code.
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all instruction paths and edge cases.
3. **Start with Lower Limits**: Initially set lower limits for fees and transaction volumes.
4. **Monitor Activity**: Implement monitoring for unusual transaction patterns.

## Known Limitations

- The current implementation does not handle escrow for NFTs.
- No built-in royalty distribution to original creators.
- Limited handling of collection metadata.

## Emergency Procedures

In case of identified vulnerabilities:

1. Alert marketplace authority
2. If possible, pause new listings
3. Address vulnerabilities through program upgrade
4. Communicate transparently with users

## Security Testing

Before production deployment:

1. Test all instruction paths
2. Verify error conditions are properly handled
3. Test edge cases with maximum/minimum values
4. Verify authority checks cannot be bypassed
