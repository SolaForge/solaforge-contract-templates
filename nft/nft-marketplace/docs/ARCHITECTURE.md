# NFT Marketplace Architecture

This document describes the architectural design of the NFT Marketplace template.

## Overview

The NFT Marketplace template provides a decentralized platform for buying and selling NFTs on Solana. It handles listing NFTs, executing sales, and managing marketplace fees.

## Core Components

### State Management

- **Marketplace**: Stores global marketplace configuration including fee structure and statistics.
- **NFTListing**: Represents a specific NFT listed for sale, including price and status.

### Instruction Processing

The template supports five primary operations:

1. **Initialize Marketplace**: Sets up the marketplace with a designated authority and fee structure.
2. **List NFT**: Allows a user to list an NFT for sale at a specified price.
3. **Buy NFT**: Enables a buyer to purchase a listed NFT, transferring ownership and funds.
4. **Cancel Listing**: Allows a seller to remove their NFT from the marketplace.
5. **Update Marketplace Fees**: Permits the marketplace authority to adjust the fee structure.

## Security Considerations

- Ownership verification for NFTs
- Authority validation for administrative actions
- Status checks to prevent double-selling
- Price validation to ensure non-zero prices
- Fee caps to prevent excessive fees

## Integration Points

This template interacts with several Solana components:

- **SPL Token Program**: For NFT transfers
- **System Program**: For SOL transfers and account creation
- **Rent Sysvar**: For rent exemption validation

## Extension Points

The NFT Marketplace can be extended to support:

- Auction mechanisms
- Bid placements
- Royalty distributions
- Collection-based listing and discovery
- Featured listings and promotions

## Implementation Notes

- Uses Borsh for efficient serialization/deserialization
- Implements account validation to ensure security
- Tracks marketplace statistics for analytics
- Handles marketplace fees transparently
