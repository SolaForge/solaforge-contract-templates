## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SolaForge/solaforge-contract-templates.git
   cd solaforge-contract-templates
   ```

2. Navigate to the template you're interested in:
   ```
   cd tokens/spl-token/basic
   ```

3. Follow the instructions in the template's documentation to build and deploy

## Template Structure

Each template follows a standard structure:

```
template-name/
├── src/               # Source code
├── tests/             # Tests
├── examples/          # Example usage
├── docs/              # Documentation
├── Cargo.toml         # Rust project configuration
└── Xargo.toml         # Solana BPF build configuration
```

## Featured Templates

### Basic SPL Token

A foundational implementation for creating and managing fungible tokens on Solana.

### NFT Marketplace

A decentralized marketplace for listing, buying, and selling NFTs with configurable fees.

### Single-Token Staking

A contract allowing users to stake tokens and earn rewards over time, with lock periods and early withdrawal penalties.

### Multisig Security

A flexible multisignature implementation that requires approval from multiple signers before executing transactions.

## Usage with SolaForge

These templates are designed to integrate with the SolaForge platform, which uses generative AI to create custom Solana applications. The platform uses these templates as foundations for more complex applications, customizing them based on user requirements.
