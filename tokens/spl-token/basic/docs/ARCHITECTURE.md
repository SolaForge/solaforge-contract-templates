# Basic SPL Token Architecture

This document describes the architectural design of the Basic SPL Token template.

## Overview

The Basic SPL Token template provides a foundational implementation for creating and managing fungible tokens on the Solana blockchain. It builds on top of the SPL Token program to provide a customizable token implementation.

## Core Components

### State Management

- **Mint**: Stores token metadata including name, symbol, decimals, and supply information.
- **TokenAccount**: Stores individual account data including balance and ownership information.

### Instruction Processing

The template supports four primary operations:

1. **Initialize Mint**: Creates a new token type with specified metadata.
2. **Initialize Account**: Creates a new account that can hold tokens.
3. **Mint To**: Creates new tokens and adds them to a specified account.
4. **Transfer**: Moves tokens between accounts.

## Security Considerations

- Authority validation for token minting
- Balance checks for transfers
- Ownership verification for all operations
- Rent exemption enforcement

## Integration Points

This template interacts with several Solana components:

- **SPL Token Program**: For core token operations
- **System Program**: For account creation
- **Rent Sysvar**: For rent exemption validation

## Extension Points

The Basic SPL Token can be extended to support:

- Freezing accounts
- Delegated transfers
- Token burning
- Transfer fees
- Vesting schedules

## Implementation Notes

- Uses Borsh for serialization/deserialization
- Leverages the SPL Token program for standard token operations
- Maintains additional metadata beyond the standard SPL token
