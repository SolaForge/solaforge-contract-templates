# Security Considerations for Basic SPL Token

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the Basic SPL Token template.

## Key Security Considerations

### Authority Controls

- **Mint Authority**: Only the designated mint authority can create new tokens.
- **Owner Authority**: Only the account owner can authorize transfers from their account.

### Input Validation

- All numeric operations are checked for overflow/underflow.
- Account ownership is verified before any operation.
- Account data is validated to ensure correct account types are used.

### Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

1. **Unauthorized minting**: Always verify the mint authority before minting tokens.
2. **Double spending**: Ensure proper balance checks before transfers.
3. **Incorrect initialization**: Validate all accounts during initialization.

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Audit before deployment**: Have the contract audited by a security professional.
2. **Start with limited supply**: For new tokens, consider starting with a limited supply.
3. **Multisig authorities**: Consider using multisig for the mint authority in production.

## Known Limitations

- The basic template does not implement advanced features like timelock or vesting.
- No built-in mechanism for token governance.

## Security Testing

Before production deployment:

1. Test all instruction paths
2. Verify error conditions are properly handled
3. Test edge cases with maximum/minimum values
4. Verify authority checks cannot be bypassed

## Emergency Procedures

In case of identified vulnerabilities:

1. If possible, freeze affected accounts
2. Notify token holders through available channels
3. Develop and deploy a patch if applicable
