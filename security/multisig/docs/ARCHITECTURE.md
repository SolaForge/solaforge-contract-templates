# Multisig Security Architecture

This document describes the architectural design of the Multisig Security template.

## Overview

The Multisig Security template provides a framework for creating multisignature accounts that require multiple approvals before executing transactions. This enables enhanced security for critical operations in decentralized applications.

## Core Components

### State Management

- **MultisigAccount**: Stores the configuration of a multisig wallet, including owners list and threshold.
- **Transaction**: Represents a pending transaction that requires approvals, with transaction data and approval status.

### Instruction Processing

The template supports six primary operations:

1. **Create Multisig**: Initializes a new multisig account with specified owners and threshold.
2. **Create Transaction**: Proposes a new transaction for approval by the multisig owners.
3. **Approve Transaction**: Records an owner's approval for a pending transaction.
4. **Execute Transaction**: Executes a transaction once it has reached the approval threshold.
5. **Remove Transaction**: Cancels a pending transaction.
6. **Change Owners**: Updates the ownership structure of the multisig account.

## Security Features

- **Threshold-based Approval**: Requires a minimum number of signers before execution.
- **Owner Validation**: Ensures only designated owners can approve transactions.
- **Transaction Status Tracking**: Prevents double execution or approval.
- **Ownership Management**: Allows controlled changes to the multisig structure.

## Integration Points

This template can be integrated with other Solana programs to provide enhanced security:

- **Treasury Management**: Secure management of project funds with multiple approvers.
- **Governance Actions**: Execute governance decisions with required stakeholder approval.
- **Cross-Program Authority**: Delegate authority to the multisig for critical operations.

## Extension Points

The Multisig Security can be extended to support:

- **Time-locked Transactions**: Add execution delays for additional security.
- **Proposal Management**: Add metadata and discussion capabilities to transactions.
- **Role-based Permissions**: Implement different thresholds for different transaction types.
- **Hardware Wallet Integration**: Enhanced support for hardware signers.

## Implementation Notes

- Uses Borsh for efficient serialization/deserialization
- Implements rigorous account validation to ensure security
- Designed to minimize transaction costs where possible
- Provides flexible transaction execution model
