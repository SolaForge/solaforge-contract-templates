# Security Considerations for Multisig Security

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the Multisig Security template.

## Key Security Considerations

### Threshold Management

- **Minimum Threshold**: Enforces a minimum of 1 and maximum of total owners.
- **Owner Uniqueness**: Prevents duplicate owners in the multisig configuration.
- **Threshold Changes**: Controls who can modify threshold values.

### Transaction Security

- **Transaction Validation**: Verifies transactions belong to the correct multisig account.
- **Double Approval Prevention**: Prevents owners from approving transactions multiple times.
- **Execution Controls**: Ensures transactions are only executed after meeting threshold requirements.

## Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

1. **Single Point of Failure**: Avoid low thresholds that defeat the purpose of multisig security.
2. **Ownership Dilution**: Prevent unauthorized additions of owners that could lower effective security.
3. **Transaction Replay**: Ensure transactions cannot be executed more than once.
4. **Owner Collusion**: Consider distribution of keys to entities with different interests.

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with higher thresholds and adjust downward if operational efficiency requires it.
2. **Test Recovery Scenarios**: Ensure all owners know how to use the multisig mechanism before deploying critical value.
3. **Document Ownership**: Maintain clear records of all owners and their verification methods.
4. **Consider Key Management**: Use hardware wallets where possible for owner keys.

## Known Limitations

- No built-in support for off-chain signatures
- Cannot dynamically adjust threshold based on transaction value
- Limited metadata for transaction descriptions
- No built-in verification of transaction contents

## Emergency Procedures

In case of compromised owner key:

1. Immediately create a transaction to remove the compromised key
2. Ensure enough remaining owners approve quickly
3. Consider creating a new multisig entirely if multiple keys are compromised

## Security Testing

Before production deployment:

1. Test with all possible owner combinations
2. Verify threshold enforcement with varied approval scenarios
3. Test edge cases with maximum/minimum values
4. Ensure proper handling of invalid transactions
