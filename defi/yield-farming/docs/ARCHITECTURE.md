# yield-farming Architecture

This document describes the architectural design of the yield-farming template.

## Overview

The yield-farming template provides a foundation for [TEMPLATE FUNCTIONALITY].

## Core Components

### State Management

- **TemplateAccount**: Stores the main account data.

### Instruction Processing

The template supports three primary operations:

1. **Initialize**: Sets up a new account with initial parameters.
2. **Operation1**: Performs the first type of operation.
3. **Operation2**: Performs the second type of operation.

## Security Considerations

- Authority validation for all operations
- Overflow protection for mathematical operations
- Account ownership verification

## Integration Points

This template can interact with:

- SPL Token Program (for token operations)
- System Program (for account creation)
- Other Solana programs via CPI

## Extension Points

The template can be extended to support:

- Additional operations
- More complex state management
- Integration with other protocols

## Implementation Notes

- Uses Borsh for efficient serialization/deserialization
- Implements rigorous error handling
- Focuses on gas efficiency
