# Security Considerations for Single-Token Staking

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the Single-Token Staking template.

## Key Security Considerations

### Authority Controls

- **Pool Authority**: Only the designated authority can update pool parameters.
- **User Authority**: Only the stake owner can withdraw or claim rewards.

### Lock Period Enforcement

- **Minimum Duration**: Enforced minimum staking duration.
- **Early Withdrawal Penalty**: Applied when unstaking before lock period ends.

### Financial Safeguards

- **Reward Availability**: Checks to ensure sufficient rewards before distribution.
- **Math Safety**: All calculations use checked operations to prevent overflows/underflows.

## Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

1. **Reward Draining**: Prevent excessive reward claims through proper timestamp tracking.
2. **Early Withdrawal Circumvention**: Ensure penalties cannot be bypassed.
3. **Reinitialization**: Prevent pool from being reinitialized by unauthorized parties.
4. **Stake Ownership**: Verify stake accounts belong to the correct user.

## Deployment Recommendations

1. **Test with Real Tokens**: Test all functions with actual SPL tokens.
2. **Audit Reward Math**: Double-check reward calculations for accuracy.
3. **Start with Limited Funds**: Initially limit the pool size until confidence is established.
4. **Monitor Reward Distribution**: Track reward distribution to ensure expected behavior.

## Known Limitations

- Single token for both staking and rewards
- Fixed reward rate across all stake durations
- No compounding rewards mechanism
- No stake delegation features

## Emergency Procedures

In case of identified vulnerabilities:

1. Alert pool authority
2. Pause new stakes if possible
3. Create migration path for existing stakes
4. Address vulnerabilities through program upgrade

## Security Testing

Before production deployment:

1. Test all instruction paths
2. Verify reward calculations with various time periods
3. Test edge cases with maximum/minimum values
4. Ensure authority checks cannot be bypassed
